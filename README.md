# zero2ai

50 learning challenges to take you (and I) from knowing nothing about building ANNs to, hopefully, "shipping your own model."

## Why this exists

1. Most intro AI courses either drown you in theory or spoon-feed you copy-paste code.
2. Real learning = struggling just enough to swear, then solving it.
3. I wanted a public record of that struggle, plus PRs beat sticky notes.

## Structure

- Within the challenges folder, each challenge will have a `description` file outlining what the challenge is as well as the solution.
