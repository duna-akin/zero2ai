50 learning challenges to take you (and I) from knowing nothing about building ANNs to, hopefully, "shipping your own model."

## Why this exists
1. Most intro AI courses either drown you in theory or spoon-feed you copy-paste code.  
2. Real learning = struggling just enough to swear, then solving it.  
3. I wanted a public record of that struggle, plus PRs beat sticky notes.
